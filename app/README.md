## 📌 About

**Rank Entha Bro** is a web application developed to simplify the Telangana EAPCET counselling process.

Students often spend hours comparing previous year cutoff PDFs and manually preparing their web options. This project automates that process by generating a personalized counselling preference list based on the student's rank, category, gender, preferred branch, district, and college type.

The application processes the official **TG EAPCET 2025 Final Phase Last Rank** dataset and recommends eligible colleges and branches in an optimized order.
